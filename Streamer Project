    </div>
    <p> This is going to be a project where I will show you things that can help you be a successful streamer. </p>
    <a> Point I will go over</a>
    <ul>
        <li> How to get started </li>
        <li> things you will need</li>
        <li> what platform to use</li>
        <li> helpful tips</li>
        <li> sponsors </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> How to get started</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>get a mic </li>
        <li> get a device you can view chat on</li>
        <li>look at stream data </li>
        <li> PUT IN HOURS</li>
        <li> play fun games</li>
        <li> sponsors</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Mic </h3>
    <p>getting a mic, can be tricky if you are streaming on a console, say ps4 or xbox1. you should get a headset or a
        placable mic, If you like to plug in a keyboard and mouse you should get a USB mic. Quick note though if you
        chose to use a keyboard and mouse, you should get a USB extension, because consoles do not have much storage you
        normally should have a USB with extra storage, this and the keyboard and mouse will take up all three slots so
        make sure to get a splitter to add the mic.</p>
    <h3>Reading Chat</h3>
    <p>getting a device you can put chat on- This can be very helpful, and it can also be easy. Using a phone is a good
        way to do this but it may be hard to read chat, so using a computer is way easier. I would recommend using an
        old laptop or laptop that is not in use it makes it much easier in the long run. If in this case, you have a PC
        with two monitors use one for chat.</p>
    <h3>Stream Data </h3>
    <p>Looking at stream data- Stream data can be very very helpful. This will allow you to see which games get the most
        views or which specific guests you decide to bring on, are the most popular. This can be helpful for many things
        but to keep it simple use it to see which games get the most views and grind that game for a little while.</p>
    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>putting in hours-- This is also important, it is important to stream lots, it can range from 1-2 hours every day
        to or larger number like 4-3 hours every other day. This is a preference thing, it is important to find what
        best fits you.</p>
    <h3> Having Fun</h3>
    <p>playing fun games- it is also very very important to have fun! Streaming is all about sharing your good times
        with people, no matter what video games do best make sure to do you, have fun, and play games you love. You will
        find the right people who love your content.</p>
    <h3> sponsors</h3>
    <p>sponsors-there are many different types of sponsors you can get the best one I would say to get is a small
        company. You can use Nightbot to plug it into your chat every few minutes it is helpful. </p>
    <br>
    <h1> Things you will need</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Laptop or access to one</li>
        <li>Nightbot</li>
        <li> Microphone</li>
        <li><strong>schedule!</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3> Laptop</h3>
    <p>It is important to have a laptop or access to one because, with a laptop or PC, you can go on Twitch, and add
        elements like mini pops-ups when someone follows.</p>
    <h3> NightBot-Mod</h3>
    <p>(night bot= NB) Nightbot-Nightbot is very, very helpful for new streams, I even still use Nightbot. This can
        allow you do to so much, I can summarize some important things that it can do, but it is truly amazing you
        should check it out for yourself. Will using NB you can have it post links to websites that you want to promote,
        and you can have it display a message, with the website link. You can put this one on a timer like every 10
        minutes it will post it in chat. You can also do giveaways using NB. You can block spamming and using certain
        words, though if you are going to block spamming it can be annoying at times if people say "w" and then "w"
        again it will time that person out for spamming.</p>
    <h3>Microphone</h3>
    <p>you should get a mic, as it helps out a lot with, not having to reply in chat to someone and just talking will
        keep people more engaged. </p>
    <h3> Schedule</h3>
    <p>It is important to have a proper schedule, Do not overwork yourself. Schedules can help you stream consistently.
        It will also give viewers a sense of when you will be streaming. Just remember to not overwork yourself as it
        can happen be rational when planning.</p>
    <h1> What platform to use</h1>
    <p>You should use something that will work for your console or PC, If you have a console I think your default is
        Twitch so that is what you will be using, you can also stream through Stream labs but you have to pay for it. On
        PlayStation consoles, your default is also Twitch, but you have a bit more customization. Now if you have a
        Laptop or PC I would use Kick, Kick has a better pay split of 95% to you and 5% to kick, witch compared to
        twitch is way better. Since the platform is relatively new you can start there easily. </p>
    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> Have Fun </li>
        <li> Try New Things</li>
        <li> Play With Friends </li>
        <li> Dont Over Complicate Things</li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Sponsors</h1>
    <p> Sponsors should not be your main priority, You should only really start thinking about sponsors with around
        1,000 followers. The best way is to find a small company that you want to support fill out the form if provided
        or just email them, and hope for the best. This is where you can use NB to plug stuff in chat like your code.
        Example NB uses !dubbys to send a chat saying use code "mitch2414" for 10% off.</p>
